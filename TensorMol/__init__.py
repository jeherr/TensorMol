"""Code Conventions and Style Guide:

- Write code modularly. In proper directories, with minimal imports.
- USE HARD TABS. configure whatever editor you are using to use hard tabs.
- UseCapitalizationToSeparateWords in names.
- Prefer long interperable words to ambiguous abbreviations. MakesDipoleTensor() >> mdt123()
- Avoid_the_underscore to separate words which takes longer to type than a cap. MakesDipoleTensor() >> Makes_Dipole_Tensor
- The underscore is a good way to denote a function argument. TakesSet(aset_)
- Keep functions to fewer than 5 parameters
- Keep files and classes to < 2000 lines.
- Keep classes to < 20 member variables.
- Keep loops to a depth < 6
- Use functional programming constructs whenever possible.
- Use Google-style docstrings, you asshole, and use Args: and Returns:
- Commit your changes once a day at least.
- Use tf.Tensor and np.array rather than python list whenever possible
- It's NOT okay to put default parameters in __init__() and change them all the time. Add them to TMPARAMS.py so they become logged and attached to results.
- import TensorMol as tm; works as desired, don't mess that up.

Violators are subject to having their code and reproductive fitness mocked publically in comments.
